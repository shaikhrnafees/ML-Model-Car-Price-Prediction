# ML-Model-Car-Price-Prediction
We aim to predict car selling prices using the "cardekho" dataset. Steps involve cleaning (handling missing values, correcting types, addressing outliers), EDA for insights, and preprocessing (encoding categories, scaling features). A RandomForestRegressor will model the selling_price, with hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance..
